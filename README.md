A site created for annual sports competition happing at my high school ([mgo.opava.cz](url)) using React. This site was meant to be first used in 2020, which is also the reason why it is unfinished. 

It features syncing timer and score counter, choosing favorite teams and checking the match schedule. It makes it easier for organisation, including pre-event team registration as well as during the day itself due to easier match delaying, standings and team members.

The site can be found on: https://vanocni-florbalovy-turnaj2-0.vercel.app/.
It is available only in Czech.
